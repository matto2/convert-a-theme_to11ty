## [The site!](https://tamras-checklist.netlify.com/)

I made this site as practice/learning experience by applying things I learned from:
* [Letâ€™s Learn Eleventy! (with Zach Leatherman) â€” Learn With Jason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8mJrhhdHWc) watched 4-5x!!

and

* [Create an Eleventy (11ty) theme based on a free HTML template](https://bryanlrobinson.com/blog/create-11ty-theme-from-static-html-template/)

But instead of a free theme I combined 11ty with Tania Rascia's lovely [Primitive UI boilerplate](https://taniarascia.github.io/primitive/)

**Huge thanks** to [Zach Latherman/11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Jason Lengstorf](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/), [Bryan Robinson](https://bryanlrobinson.com/), [Tania Rascia](https://github.com/taniarascia), github (you already here - so you know...), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), (and others, google searches, etc...)

Also, this site was made to help my wife more easily keep track of her post-surgery regimen (can be saved to home screen on iOs)...

TODOS:
* Pre-fill today's date by default
* Add detailed descriptions of categories in popovers
* Trigger number picker on iOs (instead of keyboard with numbers)
* Turn into an app? Currently this only works as a _form_ so needs to be done all at once. Would be nice to preserve states so Tamra can fill it out throughout the day, and maybe have it automatically send/reset at midnight each day... (Can 11ty do that? Does it need to be turned into a PWA? Vue or React?)
* Notifications/reminders to fill it out?
* Expose records of each day in searchable archive (with filters, etc) aka METRICS!
* "White label" it - make it available to help other people??

I don't currently know how to do any of those things so I'm open to suggestions ðŸ˜€
